title: 5. Basic checks 1
---
**Introduction**  
In this module, you will check the chapters/verses and the markers using two methods: Assignments and Progress and the project menu (4a.Checking).

**Before you start**  
You have typed your text in Paratext 9. Now you want to start checking. In this module we start with the first two basic checks. The remaining checks are covered in [BC2 – Basic Checks](../03-Stage-2/12.BC2.md) and [BC3 - Basic Checks](../04-Stage-3/19.BC3.md). 

**Why is this important?**  
These checks allow you to be sure that you have all the chapters and verses and that the other markers are correct. It is important to run the chapter/verse check first because all the other checks depend on it. Doing these checks allows you to complete the Drafting stage.

**What you are going to do**  
You are going to run the first two basic checks using two different methods. The easiest way is to run the checks from Assignments and Progress. However, you can also do the checks from the project menu **(Tools)** if you need to check more than one book at a time.



## 5.1 Running checks from Assignments and Progress
It is easier to run the checks from Assignments and Progress.

**View and correct errors**
1.  View Assignments and Progress by clicking on the blue icon ![](../media/4b0b6eb237606727f105a01beffe64c2.png)  
    (at the top right of your project window).
1.  If there are any "issues" (errors), click the blue link to the right  
    ![](../media/9b0bc6de6491c34d3e3dea878411ac11.png)
    -  *A window appears with a list of the errors*.  
1.  Double-click a line in the list.
2.  Correct the error in your project.
3.  Double-click the next line in the list.
4.  Continue for each error.

**Confirm that the errors have been corrected**
1.  Click **Rerun** button.
     - *A results list shows any remaining errors*.
2.  Fix any errors
3.  Close the results list window (if desired.
4.  Otherwise, return to the** Assignments and Progress**
5.  Click on the link to show the issues from the markers check.

:::tip
When you have finished with a check, some people like to close the results list, others like to keep it open particularly if it changes your window layout. You can also move it to a tab of another window.

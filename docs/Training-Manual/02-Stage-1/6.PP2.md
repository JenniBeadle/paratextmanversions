title: 6. Project progress 2
---
**Introduction**  
In this module, you will learn how to update your progress by marking tasks as completed. You will also create a progress report.

**Before you start**  
You have been working on your translation and have finished a task. You now want to update your progress.

**Why is this important?**   
For the project plan to work well, you need to mark the tasks you have finished. This allows Paratext 9 to make the next task available for the other team members. It also gives Paratext accurate information on your progress for the reports. Creating a progress report helps you prepare a report for your supervisors and funders.

**What you are going to do**  
You will open the assignments and progress window and update the progress made. You will then produce a report.

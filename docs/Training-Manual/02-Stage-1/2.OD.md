title: 2. Organising your desktop
---
**Introduction**  
As you work with your text in Paratext 9 you will want to see a variety of resources. In this module, you will learn how to open resources and organise your desktop.

**Before you start**  
You are getting ready to type text into an existing project. Before you can do this, someone must have already installed the program, created a project for your data and installed resources for you.

**Why is this important?**  
The translator who organises his/her desktop well has all the resources necessary for his/her work.

**What are you going to do?**  
You will start the Paratext 9 program and open a previously saved layout (text combination). If needed you will open other resources, change the arrangement of the windows and resave the text layout.

**Changes in Paratext 9**  
The menus changed in Paratext 9.0. To see the menu, you now need to click on the menu icon ≡. There are now two types of menus. The main Paratext menu is on the title bar (![](../media/a7c437f2736cb28b0dff7abd780f5f94.png)) and each window (or tab) has its own menu (![](../media/65ab77824a1e025fac1bf88feb6ba66f.png)). When you click on one of these menu icons all the menus are displayed, and you just need to click on the command.

:::tip
In this manual, when it says **≡ Paratext**, under **Menu** \> **Command** (e.g. **≡ Paratext**, under **Paratext** \> **Open**). It means click on the Paratext menu icon ≡, then under the menu (e.g. Paratext) choose the command (e.g. Open).

And when it says **≡ Tab**, under **Menu** \> **Command** it means click on the tab menu icon, then under the menu (e.g. Tools) click on the command (e.g. Wordlist). At other times it may just say **≡ project menu**.

In Paratext 9.3 the Text Collection can also be opened directly from the **≡ Paratext** menu
:::

#### New method - Open directly from Paratext menu

1. **≡ Paratext** menu, under **Paratext** \> **Open text collection**  
   ![](../media/OpenTextCol.png)

4. Repeat as necessary.
5. Use the up and down arrows to reorder them as needed.

Save the collection

1. Click in the text box in the bottom left corner.
2. Type a name for the saved collection and click the save icon
3. Click **OK**.
   - *The text collection opens*.


#### Previous method - Open dialog

   ![](../media/OpenText.en.png)
2. Click on the Resources button (at the top).
3. Select several resources using the Ctrl key as you click on the resource.
4. Repeat as necessary.
5. Click on the **Open as** dropdown list.
6. Choose **Text collection panel**
7. Click **OK**

 
:::tip
It is suggested that resources be displayed in the order of more literal to less literal (to focus on the texts that are most faithful to the source texts). For English resources: ESV, RSV, NIV, NLT. For French resources, the following order is suggested: TOB, NVSR78Col, NBS, BDS, FC97, PDV11.
:::


There are several ways to change the order of texts in the collection. One way is to use the menu.

1. **≡ Tab**, **Modify text collection**

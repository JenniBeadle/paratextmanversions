title: 22. Biblical key terms report

One task in this stage is to produce a report of the changes made in the key biblical terms.

**Before you start**  
In working on your translation you have identified and changed a number of key biblical terms.

**Why is this important?**  
Although you can’t use Paratext to write the report, it can produce of list of the terms that you have been dealing with and may need to include in your report.

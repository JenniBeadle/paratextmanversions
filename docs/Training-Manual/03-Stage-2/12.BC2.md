title: 12. Basic Checks 2
---
**Introduction**  
In this module, you will learn to do several other basic checks (**Characters**, **punctuation**, **capitals**, and **repeated words**. As in the first Basic Checks module ([**5. Basic checks**](../02-Stage-1/5.BC1.md)), it is easiest to run these checks from Assignments and Progress. However, if you want to check several books, you will need to use the **Verification** menu.

**Before you start**  
You have typed your translation in Paratext 9. Be sure that you have checked the chapter/verse numbers and markers, as described in [**Basic checks**](../02-Stage-1/5.BC1.md), before continuing and that your administrator has either completed the setup of the checks or is with you to do the setup now.

**Why is this important??**  
Paratext 9 has eleven **Basic Checks**. You have already seen the first two, chapter/verse numbers and markers. This module will help you to find errors linked to characters, punctuation, capital letters and repeated words. Even though these errors may not influence the content of the text, correcting them makes the text easier to read.

**What we are going to do:**  
Most of the checks require that an inventory has been completed by your administrator. In this module you will

-  Confirm that the setup has been done (or have the administrator do the setup)
-  do the Basic Checks
-  correct any errors.

## 12.1 Confirm the setup
Before you can run these other basic checks some form of setup must be done. Some checks require an inventory others require rules or settings. 

:::caution
You can do most of the inventories, but only your Administrator can do the rules or settings.
:::

## 12.2 Using inventories to setup checks
:::tip
These inventories show what is currently in your text, that is, both the good and the bad. You need to work through the inventory and tell Paratext 9 which elements are correct (valid) and which are errors (invalid).
:::

Once you have finished the inventory you will be ready to do the check.
1.  From the **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** \> **Checking inventories** menu, choose the appropriate inventory (for example Character inventory).
1.  Click on an item in the list in the top pane.
    -  *The verses are shown in the bottom pane.*
1.  For each item in the top pane, choose either **Valid** or **Invalid**.
1.  Repeat for each item.
1.  Click **OK**.

:::tip
Instead of using the mouse, you can use **Ctrl** + **y** to mark an entry as **Valid** or **Ctrl** + **n** to mark an entry as **Invalid**.
:::


## 12.3 Characters
:::tip
This check (and inventory) helps you identify all the incorrect characters, i.e. the characters which are not in your alphabet (as defined in the language settings ≡ Tab, under Project Properties \> Language Settings \> Alphabetic characters.
:::

### Setup required  
1.  **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** \> **Checking inventories** \> **Character inventory**
1.  For each item, choose **Valid** or **Invalid**.
:::caution
If one of your alphabetic characters is currently "Unknown", then that character should be added to your language settings by the administrator.
:::
### Check  
1.  **≡ Tab**, under **Tools**\> **Run Basic Checks**
1.  Check **Characters**
1.  Click **OK**.  
    -  *A list of errors is displayed.*
1.  Make any corrections as needed.

## 12.4 Punctuation
:::tip
This check (and inventories) helps you identify all the incorrect or misplaced punctuation marks. (It can be helpful to look at the Unicode character column to clearly identify similar punctuation.)
:::

### Setup required  
Punctuation inventory  
1.  **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** \> **Checking inventories** \> **Punctuation Inventory**
1.  Check each punctuation mark in its context.
>The contexts can be:  
**word initial**,   
**word medial**,  
**word final** or  
**isolated** (space before and after).  
   ![](../media/1c4d9844e10ce6e7e195d7d66cd35172.png)  
3. For each punctuation in its context, choose **Valid** or **Non valid** or leave as **Unknown**
4. When finished click **OK**.

Missing final punctuation  
1.  **≡ Tab**, under \> **Tools** > **Checking inventories** > **Markers Missing Final Sentence Punctuation**
1.  For each item, choose **Valid** or **Invalid**.


### Check
1.  **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** \> **Run Basic Checks**
1.  Check **Punctuation**
1.  Click **OK**.  
    -  *A list of errors is displayed.*
1.  Make any corrections as needed.

## 12.5 Unmatched Pairs
### Setup required
1.  **≡ Tab**, under \> **Unmatched pairs of punctuation**:
1.  If the list is empty, then there are no errors with these pairs of characters.
1.  If necessary, click **Options…** to add other pairs.

### Run the check
1. **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** \> **Run Basic Checks**
1. Check **Unmatched pairs of punctuation**
1. Click **OK**.  
   -  *A list of errors is displayed.*
1.  Make any corrections as needed.



## 12.6 Repeated words
:::info
This check is to identify words that have been repeated in the text. This may indicate an error, but not necessarily.
:::
#### Setup required
1.  **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** \> **Checking inventories** \> **Repeated words inventory:**
1.  For each item, choose **Valid** or **Invalid**.

#### Check

1.  Check **Repeated words**
1.  Click **OK**.  
    -  *A list of errors is displayed.*
 -  Make any corrections as needed.

## 12.7 Capitalization
:::tip
The capitalization check looks for several types of capitalization problems. There are three inventories for capitalization, but only one check. You may need to click on the **Options** button to add markers or punctuation.
:::
**Setup required**
1.  **≡ Tab**, under \> **Tools** > **Checking inventories** > **Markers followed by a lower case letter**
1.  For each item, choose **Valid** or **Invalid**.
1.  **≡ Tab**, under \> **Tools** > **Checking inventories** > **Punctuation Followed by a Lower Case letter**
1.  For each item, choose **Valid** or **Invalid**.
1.  **≡ Tab**, under \> **Tools** > **Checking inventories** > **Mixed Capitalization**
1.  If you have lowercase prefixes, click **Options** and enter the details.
1.  For each item, choose **Valid** or **Invalid**.



**Check**
1.  **≡ Tab**, under **Tools** \> **Run Basic Checks**
1.  Check **Capitalization**
1.  Click **OK**.  
    -  *A list of errors is displayed.*
1.  Make any corrections as needed.

## 12.8 Making minor corrections
:::caution
It is possible to make minor corrections from within a displayed inventory. However, if there are several errors it is best to run the check to make the corrections.
:::
1.  Click on a verse in the lower pane
1.  Hold the **Shift** and double-click
1.  Make the correction
1.  Click **OK**.

:::tip
In some cases, it is preferable to use the Wordlist or the spell checker to correct several errors at once.

**Review**  
There are many basic checks in Paratext 9. The table below summarizes the setup needed for each of the checks.

:::tip
It is possible to run all the checks at the same time, however when running the checks for the first time it is better to run them one at a time to avoid large list of errors.

title: 9. Glossary
---
**Introduction**  
This module explains how to add entries to the glossary using the **Biblical terms** tool.

**Before you start**  
You have drafted and entered your text in Paratext 9. Now you will add some glossary entries to explain some of the terms.

**Why is this important?**  
It is good to have a list of important words and their explanations so that the readers can understand the text well. Rather than typing directly into the glossary, it is better to use the **Biblical terms** tool as it keeps the Glossary in alphabetical order. The tool also keeps track of the changes to the glossary.

**What you are going to do**  
You will use the Biblical terms tool to add a rendering for the term and then use the glossary tab to enter the citation form and the definition.

There are four training videos available on [adding](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/451195974), [linking](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/499553868) and [editing](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/503489533) and getting [permission to edit](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/476293601) glossaries. (P9 1A.4a-d).

**Introduction**  
The second stage of a translation project involves checking by the team. In this second stage you will use many tools to ensure that you have been consistent in your translation. You will read through your text, work on proper names, Biblical key terms, spell checking, and formatting checks. You will also print out a draft and use a variety of notes: project notes, spelling notes, Biblical terms discussion notes to record your questions, discussions and decisions.

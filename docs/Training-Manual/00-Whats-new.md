title: What's new - Paratext 9.3
---

### Paratext Live

Paratext Live uses a couple of servers.

-   Paratext 8, 9.0, 9.1 (and 9.3) use a server called Internet (secondary) WCF 
-   Paratext 9.2 (and 9.3) use Internet (primary) AMQP.  

:::tip
This is why you can't use Paratext Live with 9.2 and 9.1 at the same time.
:::
-   In Paratext 9.3 when you start Paratext live you choose what server you want to use.
    -   **Internet (primary)**, which is 9.2 and 9.3.
    -   **Internet (secondary)** which is 9.0, 9.1 or Paratext 8.

:::note
Everyone in a particular live session still needs to use the same server, it is just that from 9.3 you can work with someone on 9.1 or someone else on 9.2 (just not at the same time)
